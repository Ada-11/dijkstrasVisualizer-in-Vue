This is the Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm built with Vuejs.
My goal was to build something with a visual effect while learning  a new framework like Vue.js.

This project was originally build by Clement Mihailescu, a former Fullstack Academy alumn using other tools.

Vue.js is an open-source framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications, like React.
